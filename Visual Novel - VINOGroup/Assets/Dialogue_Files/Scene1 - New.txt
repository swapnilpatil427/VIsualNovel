Roland~ Ah, good morning, master- ~0~R~BG/logwall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Master's not here. Where could he be? ~ 0 ~ R ~ BG/logwall ~~ 0 ~ blank:blank
Roland~ His equipment is still here as well, but he's not in bed. I doubt he'd leave before rousing me.~0~R~BG/logwall~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I should investigate. ~ 0 ~ R ~ BG/logwall ~~ 4 ~ [Investigate gear]:5% 6 % 4-[Investigate bed]:7 % 7 % 4-[Check downstairs]:8% %
Roland~ Master's armor. This set of well-worn armor is thin and light, but quite sturdy, making it ideal for long journeys or aimless wandering. ~0~R~BG/logwall~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Master is commanded to find a cure for Saint Abileneâ€™s illness, and his/her travels have brought us to the land of Attaq, where such a cure is rumored to exist. ~0~R~BG/logwall~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ The blankets are still on the bed, and it looks otherwise undisturbed. It's like he never got up, or wanted to cover his tracks for some reason.~0~R~BG/logwall~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ The door is unopened, but I can manage to get it open. Should I go check downstairs?~4~ R ~ BG/logwall ~~ 9 ~ Let's see what's downstairs.:9 % % -I should look around for more clues.:4 % %

Roland~ Thief! Freeze!~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Wait, did you just talk?~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Relinquish your stolen goods, or - wait, did I just talk?~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Talking dogs? Oh, no, regular ones are bad enough and now, talking ones....~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ But you're talking too!~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Now I must - ~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Wait, I am talking!~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Huh, I don't remember doing that yesterday.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ ...~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ ...~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ No matter, you are still stealing from the pantry. Relinquish your stolen goods, or face my blade.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Now, if I can talk, and that mutt can talk, does this mean anyone else can? Granted, my sample size is quite small, but..~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Hey! Don't ignore me~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Mate, every human's vanished, you and I are talking like people, and you're worried about some stolen food? I mean, look around, who's there to steal it from?~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Well...~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Matter of fact, I'm pretty hungry too.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Let's make a deal: you don't wring my neck and I'll share some of my food with you?~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ It's pretty high up here, too, I don't think you can get up here. Whaddaya say?~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ The cat makes a good point. Or I could just bash the cabinet and make him fall. It looks quite rickety. ~ 0 ~ R ~ BG/StoneWall ~~ 47 ~ [Cooperate with the cat]:32-[Hit the cabinet]:37
Roland~ Very well, come down. I won't hurt you.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ That's the spirit. Here, have a bone.~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Now, formal introductions. I am Dismas. I've lived in this poor excuse for a village my whole life, and I've seen many types come and go.~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Your colors, that armor design, hmm...Kelev, I wager?~0~L~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dog~ ...~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank

Roland~ Heh heh heh...~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Have some manners, will you?~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I'm sorry.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ Are you?~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Not very. So who are you, anyway?~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Cat~ My name is Dismas, and I am not fond of falling.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I am Sir Roland of Kelev. My master and I seek a cure for the ailing Saint Abilene. We are journeying to the Tower to ask the venerated mages there.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ The Tower? You mean you want to talk to those mages?~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Yes, and I wish to ask them for a cure for-~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Ah ha ha ha ha! Oh, that's funny...~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ What's so funny?~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Believing that you can get those mages to do something for you, like a favor. Oh, that's rich..and quite pathetic, frankly.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I don't understand.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Oh, those mages are terrible. They're a blight on this land - naught but ruthless, arrogant tyrants with no respect for laws or faiths.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Have you...seen these mages?~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Oh, I have. I've seen a few glimpses of their 'work' when stealing from them. It's really scary stuff, what they do.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Hmm...~ 0 ~R ~ BG/StoneWall ~ placeholder~ 67 ~ What sort of things have you seen?:58-You can tell me later. For now, we need to figure out what happened to everyone:66
Dismas~ Frankly, I can't quite remember. There were flashes of light, and always people being forced into their labs, but...~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Maybe I blocked all of it out. Wouldn't be surprised at myself, really.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ They kidnap people?~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Ohh, yes they do. I've seen em with their big bodyguards, coming through town and taking away anyone they please.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ What? Wait, is it possible that they could be responsible?~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ At this scale? I don't know, honestly. They rely on us poor farmers and villagers for food and collateral in case anyone has the bright idea of trying to take them down.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Speaking of which, where is everyone? Not that I mind, but I feel we should go look for them. I'll get some food for the road.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Yes, let us.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Good idea...just thinking of what I've seen makes my hair stand at attention. I'm going to get some food for the road.~0~R~BG/StoneWall ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ ...~0~R~BG/Black ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Wow, the village looks completely empty.~0~R~BG/villagemorning ~Wind.mp3~0~blank:blank
Roland~ You didn't notice when you got up?~0~R~BG/villagemorning ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ I'm usually up well before anyone else is up, to get my breakfast. The village is never this quiet, though. I'd expect at least a few people meandering about.~0~R~BG/villagemorning ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Did you see any animals?~0~R~BG/villagemorning ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Nah, animals aren't very common in these parts, not like Kelev where there are dogs everywhere. In this land, cats are probably the most common animal, and in this village, it's just me and the rat catcher.~0~R~BG/villagemorning ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Well, as far as non livestock animals go anyway. Us cats, like the people here, need to steal to survive.~0~R~BG/villagemorning ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Hmm...~0~R~BG/villagemorning~p~83~Why steal?:75-This land seems ruined as is..stealing seems necessary, as much as it pains me to say.:78-Resorting to theft? How dishonorable.:80
Dismas~ Why not steal? This whole land is a ruin! All of our honest coin is taken by those mages, and anyone dumb enough to attempt honest work is going to starve come winter.~0~R~BG/villagemorning ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ You want to survive here, you need to make money under the table - and everyone has been. ~0~R~BG/villagemorning ~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ The butcher smuggled things by stuffing them in his pigs. That tavern you were staying at ran quite a backdoor gambling scene.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Ah, you're an observant mutt, aren't you. All our honest coin is taken as tribute by those mages, so the rest of us need to lie, cheat, and swindle each other and passerby to survive.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Myself included, as you know. Though, my handler said once it wasn't this bad, but I suppose limitless power on par with the gods has a way of getting to your head.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Are you really that bloody dense? This land is a ruin! Everything's gone to scat ever since those mages showed up, lording over us and taking all our honest coin as 'tribute'.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ You want to survive here, you have to do dishonest work - lie, cheat, swindle, doesn't matter. That inn you stayed at, did you know the keeper ran a backdoor gambling scene?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Everyone here's a little dirty, and we have to be. Don't be so naive.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ That's a shame. Power comes with responsiblity, and it is a shame to see the land fall to ruin because of their carelessness.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Ah, yes, glorious, opulent Athaq. Land of the powerful, apathetic mages and the peasants they oppress.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ But isn't it true that they hold a cure for any ailment?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Honestly, they're so secretive I wouldn't be surprised if they owned a living, breathing dragon.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Dragons don't exist.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Clearly you haven't seen enough of our countryside.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ But, they still do hold a cure, don't they?.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ They probably do, but we've never seen it. Why waste their cures on us poor townsfolk? I feel rather fortunate to be a cat because of this - I remember more than a few times plague would take this village, and every time we were powerless to do anything about it.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Oh, that's terrible. Has no one done anything about it? The Knights of Kelev wouldn't stand for this sort of atrocity.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Oh, trust me, people have. Whether for justice, righteousness, or loot, more than a few adventurers and armies have marched on the mages.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ And every time they did, something terrible would happen to them. I think the last group that marched on them were some holy knights or something. Their insides were put outside, or something. Or worse.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Hold up, here's my house. Let me check if my handler's inside.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Your handler?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Yes, the hand that feeds me and the mouth that tells me what to steal. Oh, hm..I don't see him. I'm going to keep checking though. You should have a look around, as well.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Very well. I'll look around and see if I can't find any clues.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I wonder where everyone went..~0~R~BG/villagemorning~p~99~[Speak to Cat]:99-[Investigate the houses]:152-[Investigate the town square]:153-[Investigate town edge]:154
Dismas~ Yeah? What is it?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ What to say...~0~R~p~p~100~Do you have any ideas where everyone went?:101-What else do you know of this village?:111-What else have you seen, or know of the mages?:131-Nothing, carry on.:99
Dismas~ Can't say for certain, honestly. I'm as confused as you are. Try looking for any traces of where they could have gone - footprints, something, anything. You're a dog, dogs are good at tracking. Go track.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Have you tracked down your owner?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ No, unfortunately. His equipment, his boots are still here.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Are you worried for your owner?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ I'm-look, he's not my owner. He just feeds me.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ You sound worried.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ I'm not worried, just - let me focus!~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Very well, you seem rather emotionally invested...~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ ...~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Any further questions?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Thereâ€™s not much to say, really. Weâ€™re just a village on the way to the Tower, so we get a lot of people coming through here that want to visit the mages, for some reason or another. Usually dignitaries or diplomats or some such visitors. They make easy pickins though, heh heh heh.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ What is the tower, exactly? My master didn't learn much when we were briefed on our quest.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ The Tower serves as the main liaison between the Spire mages and the rest of us puny mortals.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ There's actually a lot of 'towers', per se, but the primarily liaison is THE Tower, which I assume you were heading to. Most mages live and work in the Spire, their big floating fortress in the middle of nowhere.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ I mean, according to myth you can't even get in from the ground. It's above a lake of fire or something. You want to get in, you have to go to one of the Towers, and teleport your way in.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ A lake of fire? No way.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Well, they certainly are powerful enough to create a lake of fire. And I'll be honest, if I were a great, powerful lord, I'd want a lake of fire to keep the pesky peasants out.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ It's intimidating, you know?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I don't see the point, though...why antagonize your populace like that?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Erh...~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Well, at least it'd keep me warm in the wintertime.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ And roast you in the summertime.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Point taken. I wonder if those mages feel toasty right now.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ We are blessed with warm weather right now, so I would imagine so.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Would they be able to extinguish it in the summer or something? Maybe they'd have some cooling magic beneath them in the summer.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ That sounds terribly inefficient.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Yeah, suppose you got a point. Hey, I'm not a mage, I'm just guessing.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ You seem to know quite a bit about local politics.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ My handler was a politics professor. He went a little nutty and started talking to his cat, and I eventually picked up.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I see.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ All I know is that theyâ€™re not to be trifled with, at all. Iâ€™ve stolen my share of a few things from them - coins, mostly, occasionally an expensive brooch or two. ~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Those mages love covering their robes and weighing down their necks and wrists with jewelry. Fortunately they never seem to notice when a few necklaces go missing. ~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Hey, it pays the bills, Iâ€™m not complaining.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ How extravagant. In Kelev, even the wealthiest and most powerful wore simple garbs.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Well, my friend, this isn't Kelev. Different strokes for different folks, ya know.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ In Aquila, they put blue eagles on absolutely everything, in the South it's rubies, serpents, and  yellow, and in the North it's all fur.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Also consider that they're the ruling class of Athaq, my friend. They can wear whatever they please.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Haven't you ever seen them visit you and collect tribute?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I don't believe so.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Really? From what I know, they make rather regular visits to each land. Are you sure?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I'm sure.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ There's always some bloke in a long black robe, neck and wrists heavy with jewelry. They're always flanked by these two big bodyguards in pitch-black plate armor. You've NEVER seen them come around?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I don't believe so. Kelev is a strong, prosperous land with a history of victory over magic.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ I hope I wasn't hallucinating seeing them around. ~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Do tell me more, though.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ I saw them once, just passing through. Based on what my handler said, they'll send a mage and bodyguards through an area, find the local leader, and make their demands.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Usually it's grain and coin, but occasionally they'll ask for alchemical reagents, animals and people. There's no set pattern to the people, though.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Sometimes they'll need a few albino kids, sometimes it's identical female adult twins, sometimes it's feeble old men. They don't ask for much of the latter, but any who defy them...have things happen to them.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Terrible things?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Terrible things.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ These houses look poor and ruined. Most of the doors are barred shut, as if people were still sleeping inside. I don't see any way I can get inside.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ There's nary a soul, nor a trace of one in the town. Where could everyone have gone?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ The outskirts are also empty, but I see something odd on the ground. Should I investigate it? ~ 0 ~ L ~ ~ ~ 98~[Investigate]:155-[Come back later]:99
Roland~ That's rather disturbing - on the ground is a black silhouette of a person, but there is nothing to cast it. A small mound of dust or something is piled at the feet. Should I tell Dismas? ~ 0 ~ M ~ ~  ~ 98 ~ [Inform him]:155-[Maybe not]:98
Roland~ Dismas, I found something interesting.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Bah, nothing...Hm? What'd you find?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ I found a...shadow.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ A what?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ A shadow!~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Oi, mate, guess what, I found one too! It's right below you, cast by these shacks! Look, another one behind you!~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ No, not like that. It's a silhouette of a person on the ground, but there's no person to cast it.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Okay, now that sounds creepy.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ There's also a mound of dust at the feet.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Okay, that's DEFINITELY creepy. Let's go look.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Oh, that poor sap. Oh, this day gets worse and worse...~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ There's a definite direction to it.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Yeah, I can see it. It's pointing west.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Which means that what cast it came from the east.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Oh, right, right.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ What lies to the east?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ I honestly have no idea.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Really? I thought you were familiar with the lay of the land.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Not really...my handler was. I haven't been out much, just scaled the Tower and prowled around this village my whole life.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Do I look like I travel well?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ You sounded like you were well traveled.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ I can barely walk a mile without getting blisters. My paws are made for climbing, not for terrain.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Any idea who this is?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ I think so. Could've been the village bum. He gave me a scrap of bread one time.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ You knew him?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Yeah, I think so. I think he used to be a knight, who became disgraced and eventually wandered his way here. Poor guy didn't even have a bed to sleep in.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ What a terrible fate to be consigned to.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Yeah, well, anyways, this means we got a clue on where to head next.~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Are we heading that way?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
Dismas~ Hey, we can't stay here forever, can we?~0~R~BG/villagemorning~~0~blank:blank
