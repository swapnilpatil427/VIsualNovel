Kalen~ Look, a town ahead. I see an inn, and with it, respite.~0~R~Backgrounds/villagefar ~~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ I'm exhausted, but invigorated in knowing that our journey is coming to a close.~0~R~Backgrounds/villagefar ~~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ Are you looking forward to the end, too?~0~R~Backgrounds/villagefar~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ *pant pant*~0~R~Backgrounds/villagefar~~14~[Bark]:10%11%14-[...]:12%13%14~0~R~Backgrounds/room ~~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ Good, let us steel ourselves for the end.~0~R~Backgrounds/villagefar~Sounds/DogBark~0~d:d
Kalen~ We will press on, our hearts strong.~0~R~Backgrounds/villagefar~~0~d:d
Kalen~ Ah, you're weary, I can tell. ~0~R~Backgrounds/villagefar~~0~d:d
Kalen~ Let's focus on getting some rest.~0~R~Backgrounds/villagefar~~0~d:d
Kalen~ Take this coin, get us a room at the inn. I'll see if I can resupply us for the last leg of our journey.~0~R~Backgrounds/villagefar ~Sounds/Coinjangle~0~blank:blank
Innkeeper~ Hmm...?~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper ~~0~blank:blank
Innkeeper~ Ah, a Kelev hound. No one else would dress up their dogs in armor like that.~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper ~~0~blank:blank
Innkeeper~ My my, aren't you an impressive specimen. Are you tired, boy?~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper~~22~[Bark]:18%19%22-[...]:20%21%22
Innkeeper~ Ah, I see, you're a smart boy, too.~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper~Sounds/DogBark~0~d:d
Innkeeper~ We don't get many hounds like you out here.~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper~~0~d:d
Innkeeper~ You must be awfully tired.~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper ~~0~blank:blank
Innkeeper~ Luckily for you, we have a few rooms available. ~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper~~0~d:d
Innkeeper~ Where are you headed?~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ 'Food...'~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper~~28~[Bark]:24%25%28-[Silence]:26%27%28
Innkeeper~ I'm talking to a dog, what sort of response did I expect..?~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper~Sounds/DogBark~0~d:d
Innkeeper~ I need to get a hold of myself...~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper~~0~d:d
Innkeeper~ I'm talking to a dog, what sort of response did I expect..?~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper~~0~d:d
Innkeeper~ Why am I talking to a dog...~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper~~0~d:d
Innkeeper~ Anyway, suppose you’re looking for a place to stay. There’s enough here for one night. There’s an available room upstairs.~0~R~Backgrounds/innkeeper ~~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ Oh, my feet are so weary...~0~R~Backgrounds/room ~Sounds/OldDoor~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ How long have we traveled? Do you remember?~0~R~Backgrounds/room ~~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ Days faded into weeks and then months...I can't really complain though, the trip was boring, but quite safe.~0~R~Backgrounds/room ~~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ At least this building's roof looks secure. Remember that one inn that was hit by cannon fire?~0~R~Backgrounds/room ~~0~blank:blank
Roland~ Rrrr....~0~R~Backgrounds/room~~38~[Bark]:34%35%38-[...]:36%37%38
Kalen~ Yes, and then the village elders asked us to help them secure construction material stolen by the local bandits. ~0~R~Backgrounds/room~Sounds/DogBark~0~d:d
Kalen~ There weren't even any bandits! They just lost the key to the warehouse! Ah, good times...~0~R~Backgrounds/room~~0~d:d
Kalen~ There were an awful lot of inns, campfires, and beds. I can barely remember myself. ~0~R~Backgrounds/room~~0~d:d
Kalen~ As long as I have you, though, that's all that matters.~0~R~Backgrounds/room ~~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ Hopefully these mages will grant us their panacea, lest we need to force it from their hands.~0~R~Backgrounds/room ~~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ We must not forget our holy purpose.~0~R~Backgrounds/room ~~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ Lest Abilene perish, and our country suffer.~0~R~Backgrounds/room ~~0~blank:blank
Kalen~ Well, time for bed. Goodnight, my friend.~0~R~Backgrounds/room~Sounds/ExtinguishCandle~0~blank:blank
